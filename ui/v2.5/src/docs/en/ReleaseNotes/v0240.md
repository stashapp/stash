This release introduces scraper and plugin management interfaces. This allows installing, updating and removing scrapers and plugins from the WebUI. 

Default package sources have been automatically configured to point at the _stable_ branches of the `CommunityScrapers` and `CommunityScripts` repositories. These branches will correspond to the current stable version of stash. 

**Note:** existing scrapers and plugins will _not_ be able to be managed using the management interface. It is recommended that any existing scrapers and plugins that are available from the community repositories are backed up and removed from the applicable `scrapers` or `plugins` directory, and reinstalled using the management UI.

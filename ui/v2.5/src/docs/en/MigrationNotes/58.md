This migration corrects the plugin and UI settings in `config.yml` to use `camelCase` instead of `snake_case`. As a result, the migrated file will not be compatible with previous versions of stash. A backup of the current `config.yml` will be created in the same directory with the name `config.yml.57.<date and time>`. The exact filename is written to the log.

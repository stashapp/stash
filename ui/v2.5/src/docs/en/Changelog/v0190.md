### 💥 Known issues
* Performer autotagging does not currently match on performer aliases. This will be addressed when finer control over the matching is implemented.

### ✨ New Features
* Added support for plugins to add injected CSS and Javascript to the UI. ([#3195](https://github.com/stashapp/stash/pull/3195))
* Added disambiguation field to Performers, to differentiate between performers with the same name. ([#3113](https://github.com/stashapp/stash/pull/3113))

### 🎨 Improvements
* Changed performer aliases to be a list, rather than a string field. ([#3113](https://github.com/stashapp/stash/pull/3113))

### 🐛 Bug fixes
* Fixed scene wall items to show file base name where scene has no title set. ([#3242](https://github.com/stashapp/stash/pull/3242))
* Fixed image exclusion pattern being applied to all files. ([#3241](https://github.com/stashapp/stash/pull/3241))
* Fixed missing captions not being removed during scan. ([#3240](https://github.com/stashapp/stash/pull/3240))

##### üí• Note: The cache directory is now required if using HLS/DASH streaming. Please set the cache directory in the System Settings page.

##### üí• Note: The image data subsystem has been reworked in this release. Existing systems will have their storage system set to `Database`, which stores all image data in the database. This can be changed in the System Settings page. 

A migration is required to change the storage system, and can be accessed from the Tasks page.

The `Database` storage system is not recommended for large libraries, as it can cause performance issues. The `Filesystem` storage system is recommended for large libraries, and is the default for new systems.

##### üí• Note: the `generated/screenshots` jpg files are now considered legacy. These files can be migrated into the blob storage system by running the `Migrate Screenshots` task from the Tasks page. 

Once migrated, these files can be deleted. The files can be optionally deleted during the migration.

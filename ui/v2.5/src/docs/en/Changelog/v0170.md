After migrating, please run a scan on your entire library to populate missing data, and to ingest identical files which were previously ignored.

### 💥 Known issues and other changes
* Missing covers are not currently regenerated.
* Import/export schema has changed and is incompatible with the previous version.

### ✨ New Features
* Allow overriding UI localisation strings. ([#2837](https://github.com/stashapp/stash/pull/2837))
* Populate name from query field when creating new performer/studio/tag/gallery. ([#2701](https://github.com/stashapp/stash/pull/2701))

### 🎨 Improvements
* Encode reserved characters in query URLs. ([#2899](https://github.com/stashapp/stash/pull/2899))
* Object titles are now displayed as the file basename if the title is not explicitly set. The `Don't include file extension as part of the title` scan flag is no longer supported.

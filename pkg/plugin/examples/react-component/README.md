This is a reference React component plugin. It replaces the `details` part of scene cards with a list of performers and tags.

To build:
- run `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`
- run `yarn run build`

This will copy the plugin files into the `dist` directory. These files can be copied to a `plugins` directory.
